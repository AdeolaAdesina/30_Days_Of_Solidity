# Ethereum

Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality. 
 
It supports a modified version of Nakamoto consensus via transaction-based state transitions. Ethereum provides a cryptocurrency token called "ether", which can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed.
 
 # Smart Contract 
 
A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible.

# The Ethereum Virtual Machine

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a Turing-complete virtual machine that allows anyone to execute arbitrary EVM Byte Code. It is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is not only responsible for enforcing the agreement between the parties involved, but also for providing a secure and reliable execution environment. The EVM executes code exactly as intended, deterministically and in a trustless manner.

# Ways to connect to an Ethereum node.

1. Geth: Geth is an Ethereum client written in Go language and is the most popular way to connect to an Ethereum node.

2. Parity: Parity is an Ethereum client written in Rust language and is the second most popular way to connect to an Ethereum node.

3. Web3: Web3 is a JavaScript library that allows developers to interact with Ethereum nodes through web browsers or other web-based applications.

4. Infura/Alchemy: Infura is a hosted service that provides access to Ethereum nodes without having to run your own node.

5. MetaMask: MetaMask is a browser extension that allows users to interact with Ethereum nodes directly from their web browser.


In this class, we will be connecting through metamask. Link to have metamask install = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afATAw7iuUM


# Blockchain layers

Layers help us understand and categorize the architecture of a blockchain.

Layer 0 is a root layer that allows blockchains to exchange data with each other. Exchanging data between Bitcoin and Ethereum would have been impossible.  Polkadot is a layer 0.

Layer 1 is a foundational layer that is responsible for processing and validating transactions on its network. Bitcoin and Ethereum are layer 1.

Layer 2 solutions aim to speed up layer 1 by packaging up a bunch of transactions and sending them as one. This reduces time per transaction and transaction fees. Popular layer 2 tokens are Polygon and Loopring.

Layer 3 is the application layer that serves as the user interface. These decentralized applications can be anything from play to earn games to DeFi apps. Layer 3 cryptos are UniSwap or Decentraland. 

Because building on Layer 1 is very expensive, in this class we will be building our smart contracts on a Layer 2 blockchain called Polygon.
